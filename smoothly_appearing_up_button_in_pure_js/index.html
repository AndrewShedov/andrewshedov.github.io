I was shown to the room, was given a key and a porter carried my suitcases upstairs. After that I gave him some tipping. When I came in the room, I started unpacking my personal effects. Then I took a shower and went to bed. Next day I checked out of the hotel, caught a taxi and went on the excursion around Cairo. If I happen to visit Egypt once more in my life, I will reserve an inexpensive room in good time.
